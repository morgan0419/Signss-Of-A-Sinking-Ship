            <div class="paragraph1"><p>I usually am able to study for my tests. In the beginning of the year, <em>I was getting 100s on everything. My GPA was even a 4.0.</em> Things have changed since my parents have started arguing more. My mom usually storms out of the house, my dad slams his bedroom door shut, and <em>I’m in charge of taking care of myself and my younger siblings.</em> I have to feed them dinner, clean up the kitchen, make sure they bathe, and help them with everything else that they need. If no one else is taking care of them, I’ve decided that I should step up and do it myself.

            <div class="paragraph2">
                <p>These younger siblings of mine take up a lot of time. By the time they’re in bed, I go to sleep as well. This means that <em>I don’t get any of my homework done. My test grades have been slipping severely </em>due to this. My <em>teachers think I’m just being lazy, but they don’t know about what’s happening</em> at home. I’m too embarrassed to tell them and am <em>afraid of what will happen</em> once they find out. <em>I didn't know who to turn to.</em>
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph3">
                <p> Today, I got my report card. I am really upset about my grades. <em>I went from having a 3.7 GPA to a 2.9.</em> On one test I recently got back from my favorite class, I had a 23%. I want to fix this, but <em>I don’t really know how to.</em> If I don’t keep my family together, who will?
