                To Sleep or NOT to Sleep</u></b>
            </div><br>
            <div class="paragraph1"><p><em>I am constantly tired. Everyday</em> I wake up with bags under my eyes. <em>Everyday</em> I am falling asleep in another class. <em>Everyday</em> I act out because of it. I can’t seem to control my emotions and this is all due to the lack of sleep I never receive. Just the other night for instance I was up until 5am reading up on my assignment, and although I admit I’m a huge procrastinator...this time was <em>not my fault.</em> My teacher literally assigned  me 5 assignments over one night. This is something that happens on the daily. So, <em>I force myself to stay up at all costs.</em>

                </p></div>
            <div class="paragraph2">
                <p>I can’t miss anymore assignments. If I do, I’m going to fail my class. <em>If I fail this class, there’s no way any college is going to want me as their student.</em>I need to go to a good college in order to get a good job. Although these homework assignments may not seem like they’re going to make an effect in the long run, they are. In order to keep up with this <em>tremendous workload</em>, I always drink coffee and even <em>take Modafinil, a pill</em> that allows me to stay uo and finish my work.

                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph3">
                <p>I know I shouldn’t take these pills, but <em>it is very useful for me.</em> A lot of my friends do it as well. We all are able to keep on top of our work that way. <em>It is seen as the “norm” at my high school.</em> It’s 3 a.m. right now. Without these pills, how will I get through the school day? I need them in order to thrive as a student.
