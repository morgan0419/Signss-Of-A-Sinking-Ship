                Deep Sea Pressure</u></b>
            </div><br>
            <div class="paragraph1"><p> I’ve always strived in school. But this year, something has changed. <em>I feel all this added pressure from my parents, peers, and teachers. I need</em> to keep a 4.0 GPA, score a 1400 on the SAT, and keep on top of my work for 6 different classes. In middle school, I could easily handle this. Since coming to high school, <em>I’ve worried that my best isn’t good enough. I often panic</em> about this and try to work twice as hard. I stay up late studying and practicing so I can do well in my classes.


                </p></div>
            <div class="paragraph2">
                <p> Due to this, <em>I’ve developed severe anxiety.</em> I can’t catch my breath and I go in a downward spiral. This happens <em>every time I go to school.</em> I get these <em>feelings of self-doubt.</em> I think <em>I’m stupid and a failure and not worthy of a good college.</em> I struggle to get through the endless amounts of work thrown at me. <em>I feel really alone</em> and I have even started undergoing therapy to help me. 

                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph3">
                <p>  I thought that I was alone. But in actuality, this isn’t true. <em>Nearly 30% of teens feel the exact same way.</em> Not all go through treatment, although it is definitely helped me find different thought processes. right now, I’m cramming for a test and still feel stressed right now. <em>It’s hard to get through the day.</em> I try to use the techniques that were taught to me in therapy to have a better mindset when it comes to these things. <em>I still go through moments of frustration and defeat. It’s a struggle to cope with my anxiety and frustration sometimes.</em>
