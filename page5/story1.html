                The Fast Lane</u></b>
            </div><br>
            <div class="paragraph1"><p>When I started high school, I was immediately shocked by the fast pace, lack of intimacy, and workload. It wasn’t unmanageable in freshman year, but afterwards I always felt like <em>I was drowning in responsibilities that no one warned me about.</em> I went to one of those suburban schools where <em>“excellence is expected” and anything less is seen as lazy and unmotivated.</em><em>No one talked about mental health</em> and it’s hard to start a conversation when everyone just seemed fine. I think sophomore year is when I started to get depressed. I missed meals, slacked on work, didn’t go out with friends. <em>It felt like the world was moving so fast but I was stuck in slow-motion.</em> </p></div>
            <div class="paragraph2">
                <p>Looking back on it now, I realize that I probably wasn’t the only one who felt like this, but that’s not what I thought at the time. Since no one told me that high school wasn’t as easy as middle school (in fact it was 10x harder) and <em>no one validated my emotions or even let me express them, I felt like I was alone in this.</em> Junior year came and with it, the stress of college, SAT’s, and being a failure. When I didn’t score as high as my parent’s liked me too, and I got my first ever D, I became volatile. I began to think, <em>‘what if this is it? What if this is what the rest of my life is like?’</em> And for a moment, I considered how good it would feel to just <em>escape all of it and never have to deal with life’s tribulations again.</em> That was probably my lowest point.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph3">
                <p> <em>I am better now</em>, and I have seeked help in the form of therapy, but not everyone is as fortunate. Schools are a haven for learning and growing, but where there is fresh water there is always bacteria, algae, and all sorts of nasty stuff. <em>Bullying, emotional abuse, and overload symptoms thrive in a high school environment.</em> And without proper education and mediation when it comes to mental health, they will continue to thrive in an environment full of malleable, naive teenagers. Not only should <em>we be discussing these issues</em>, but <em>we should be taking preventative steps</em>, ensuring that no one will have to endure what I had to go through, or worse. High school is a time for identity, growth, and learning. But how can that occur when obstacles impede teenagers every day? <em>We must learn to fix this problem as a society, or else high school will just be that place that causes 3% of teens to kill themselves.</em></p>
