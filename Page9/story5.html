                Balance</u></b>
            </div><br>
            <div class="paragraph1"><p>Junior year has to be the worst one yet. I have <em>piles and piles of homework</em> each week. I carry so many books home that my book bag ripped. I stay up each day trying to finish it all up, but <em>it’s hard.</em> I have an hours worth of work in all 6 of my classes. The work is extremely hard and I struggle to get through it. <em>It’s impossible for me to balance these classes, my extracurriculars, and a social life.</em>

                </p></div>
            <div class="paragraph2">
                <p>Because of this, I feel an enormous amount of stress. <em>I rarely go out</em> and when I do, all I can think about is all the work I have to finish. <em>It’s so hard to focus on the good weather, a friend’s party, or even family time when all I can think about is the 4 projects, 2 essays, and 3 quizzes due within the next week.</em> My mood has definitely changed since the start of high school, but even more so since the start of junior year. Not only do I rarely go out and spend time with my friends, but <em>I also rarely have time to do things that benefit my mental health.</em> I used to do yoga, meditation, and play video games to relieve stress. Now those things only cause my more stress because all I can think about is the work I should be doing. <em>I feel like if I’m not constantly working, I might as well be doing nothing at all.</em>


                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph3">
                <p><em>This extremely busy lifestyle has had inverse effects on my mental health, emotional health, and physical health.</em> And the simple truth is that it doesn’t have to be this way. <em>The amount of work given to us in school is not the best way to help us learn.</em> Imagine this:  your teachers give you 5 busy-work assignments, all varying difficulties, due the next day. If you ask any student, they will tell you that they will either A) Get the answers from a classmate B) Look them up online or C) Simply not do it. Now imagine if you gave 2 meaningful assignments. Students would be much more likely to complete them on their own, as it is not as much of a workload, so it’s not as overwhelming. <em>Schools must learn how to not overload their students with work that we won’t even do.</em> Assignments need to be thought out carefully and given with reason. Otherwise students will always stay up until 2AM finishing meaningless work.
